Pain Rules,,,,
"1. Keep Pain under a 3/10 At all times, and make sure NO PAIN is sharp in quality",,,,
"2. If pain improves during the sets, AWESOME. You can progress things. If it gets worse, back off. Decrease ROM, Weight or activity.",,,,
"3. If 24 hours after the session your having MORE pain than the previous days, take a day off and rest the shoulder ",,,,
"4. If pain is increasing, take a step back. Decrease intensity of exercise until pain corrects and you note progress",,,,
