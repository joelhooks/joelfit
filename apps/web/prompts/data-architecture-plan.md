- [x] Zod validation
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Slug support
- [x] Test coverage

### 1.2 Profile Repository âœ…
- [x] Strong typing
- [x] Proper data structure
- [x] Slug generation
- [x] Initial data setup
- [x] Test coverage

### 1.3 Meal Plan Repository âœ…
- [x] Strong typing with Zod schemas
- [x] Proper data structure for meal plans
- [x] Slug generation from names
- [x] Initial data setup
- [x] Test coverage
- [x] Clean error handling

### 1.4 Equipment Repository âœ…
- [x] Strong typing with Zod schemas
- [x] Proper data structure for equipment
- [x] Slug generation from names
- [x] Initial data setup
- [x] Test coverage
- [x] Clean error handling

### 1.5 Shopping Repository âœ…
- [x] Strong typing with Zod schemas
- [x] Proper data structure for shopping lists
- [x] Slug generation from names
- [x] Initial data setup
- [x] Test coverage
- [x] Clean error handling

## Phase 2: Config to Repository Migration ðŸš§

### 2.1 Route Analysis âœ…
- [x] Audit /eat routes for config usage
  - equipment: uses equipmentRepo, storageGuide, maintenanceSchedule
  - framework: uses equipmentRepo, has inline data
  - meal-plan: uses mealPlan from joel config, has inline data
  - shopping: uses shoppingList from joel config
- [x] Map config data to repositories
- [x] Document data flow changes
- [x] Identify shared components needing updates

### 2.2 Equipment Migration âœ…
- [x] Move equipment config to repository data
- [x] Update equipment routes
- [x] Update dependent components
- [x] Add tests for new implementations

### 2.3 Profile Migration âœ…
- [x] Move profile config to repository data
- [x] Update schema to match config structure
- [x] Add support for strength areas and action plan
- [x] Update tests for new schema
- [x] Fix initialization logic

### 2.4 Framework Migration ðŸš§
- [ ] Move framework config to repository data
- [ ] Update framework routes
- [ ] Update dependent components
- [ ] Add tests for new implementations

### 2.5 Meal Plan Migration
- [ ] Move meal plan config to repository data
- [ ] Update meal plan routes
- [ ] Update dependent components
- [ ] Add tests for new implementations

### 2.6 Shopping Migration
- [ ] Move shopping config to repository data
- [ ] Update shopping routes
- [ ] Update dependent components
- [ ] Add tests for new implementations

## Phase 3: Cleanup ðŸš§

### 3.1 Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove old config files
- [ ] Update imports to use repositories
- [ ] Clean up unused code
- [ ] Update documentation

### 3.2 Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Test all routes with new repositories
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test data consistency

### 3.3 Performance
- [ ] Optimize repository initialization
- [ ] Add caching where needed
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Profile and optimize as needed
